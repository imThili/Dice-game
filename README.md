# Dice-game
An android app game named Thirty where you have 10 turns to make a maximum of 30 throws.

## How to Play
Thirty is quite similar to Yatzy. Each turn you can throw five dice three times. After each throw, you can choose which dice to keep. The rest will be rerolled during the next throw.

After throwing your dice three times, you receive points depending on how you combine the pips on your five dice.

As there are 10 turns, there are 10 different options in how to gather points:

* low: You get points per pin for all dice that have a value below 4 pins.
* 1 - 12: Each combination you make shall have the same amount of pins as the option you have chosen.
  * Clarification: If you choose the option 6, you can have all dice with 6 pins (30 points). Or you can have a combination of two dice with 2 and 4 pins, and three dice with 3, 2 and 1 pins for instance (total 12 points).
